In the script, change ## USER INPUT ## section as requried

Note with 10 minute outputs animation file size can be large over longer periods. 

### rain_accum_animation.py

Author: Mathew Lipson

This will load a netcdf and plot each time period with:
 - instantaneous rain rate
 - cumulative precipitation

It is set up for my file system, so you will need to edit for your needs, but 
the basic functions should be transferable
